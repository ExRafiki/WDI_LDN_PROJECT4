<span style="color:red">##GA PROJECT NUMBER 4:</span>

###Goal:

This was the final project of the course.Using React an application of our choice had to be made using all of the different principles and knowledge we acquired during the course.I was sure that i wanted to focus on the gaming industry but wanted to use data and display it using the knowledge that i have acquired rather then pick up a framework to build a game around.

###Languages used:

* HTML5
* JavaScript
* SCSS
* React

* APIS

###Released on

* Github
* Heroku

##Name - JUSTGAME

The goal was set to create an application that gave you access to the latest games , information about then and the ability to share reviews about the games you love.

##Process

###Research

I started by searching certain game catalog as well as reviewing websites to see how certain things appealed to me as well as what i felt was missing in their implementation of the concept.

###Development

* 1 - Firstly i focus on getting as much knowledge with the API i decided to use (IGDB) and getting the data i wanted using Insomnia.
* 2 - Then laying out the structure of the website and applying my early design concepts to the actual page/components layout.
* 3 - Displaying some data on the page , working my way up to a certain amount of data.
* 4 - Carousel implementation and formatting of the image data that was coming in from the API.

###Lessons learned:

*  Use of commercial level API.
*  Advantages to React from previous frameworks.
*  Working on the largest project since the start of the course and how to handle the workload.
*  Proper separation of tasks (avoiding head-rushing into a problem attempting to solve the entirety )
*  Improvement on overall design.

###Challenges

*  Application of theory to practice.
*  Using the carousel with my data and for it to be displayed on data sync , not on page load.
*  Filtering as well as reducing the amount of requests being made to the API.

###Goals achieved

- [X] Make the application that i envisioned.
- [X] Creating a design for the game show component that was pleasing to the eye and simple.
- [X] Using a commercial API in an effective manner.
- [ ] <span style="color:red">Favoriting a game for the user and display it on their user page</span>

###Future Features

* I would like to bring the entire concept to the end of the vision i had for the application.This would involve getting data from different end points of the same api to display platform , rating , ESRB Rating amongst others .As well as polishing the user / community pages to feel like a vibrant experience.
